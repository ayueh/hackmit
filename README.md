The idea for this project derived from these two articles:

http://www.extremetech.com/mobile/92946-a-wiggly-approach-to-smartphone-keylogging
http://www.cs.uml.edu/~xinwenfu/Classes/91.661.201/MobilePhoneSecurityPapers/11.Marquardt.CCS.(sp)iPhone%20-%20decoding%20vibrations%20from%20nearby%20keyboards%20using%20mobile%20phone%20accelerometers.pdf

Both demonstrate the power of cell phones, and also the precision of an accelerometer. This project is designed to use any hard surface as a keyboard, just touch type around your phone and it will hopefully input whatever you are typing.

This was done at HackMIT.
